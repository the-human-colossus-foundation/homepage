	<p>
    The convergence of technology and data is propelling us into an era of
    artificial intelligence. Instant access to information continues to broaden
    the scope of our fascination with final frontier exploration and the rich
    fauna and flora diversity here on Earth. It also facilitates improved
    personal healthcare and the development of life-changing cures for rare,
    chronic and fatal diseases.  
	</p>
	<p>
    “Data” is the fuel behind these quality of life advancements, bringing a
    deeper level of insight, knowledge and value to civil society. In
    conjunction with these insights, we are witnessing the dawn of an emerging
    decentralized data economy where prosperity, freedom, fairness and
    education can be enjoyed by all.
	</p>
	<p>
    Welcome to the Human Colossus Foundation, a technological home for
    collaborative projects for the betterment of humanity and the planet. Our
    vision is to facilitate a new paradigm in web interaction where innovative
    human-centric business models can be tested and developed by leveraging
    user-centric services, data aggregation, self-sovereign identity and
    distributed trust frameworks.
	</p>

	<p>We are a non-profit foundation based in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

	<h2>Tribute</h2>
	<p>The idea of the “Human Colossus” was born in an article on
	Brain-Machine interfaces by 	
	<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">
		Tim Urban
	</a>
	who coined the concept to better explain the progress of human civilization.

	<pre>
When language came into existence, ideas, experiences and
knowledge started to transfer and then accumulate. Hence, the
Human Colossus was born – the analogy of a collective organism
comprised of billion cells, each represented by a single
person.

	<h2>Decentralized Data Economy</h2> 
	<p>Decentralized Data Economy (DDE) is a new ecosystem that has emerged
	out of data usage and privacy expectations in the digital world. The
	main goal of the Human Colossus Foundation is to facilitate the
	creation and subsequent development of DDE by helping communities,
	businesses and individuals to integrate with (and participate in) this
	new ecosystem on equal terms.  </p>
  <p>
    We have identified the following key components for the integral development of DDE:
  </p>

        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://odca.online">Overal Capture Architecture (OCA)</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://colossi.app">Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA)</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#">Meaningful Service Providers (MSP)</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#">Purpose based consent (PBC)</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#">Purpose based Services (PBS)</a></li>
        </ul>
